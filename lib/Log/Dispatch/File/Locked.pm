# ABSTRACT: Subclass of Log::Dispatch::File to facilitate locking

__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch;

  my $log = Log::Dispatch->new(
      outputs => [
          [
              'File::Locked',
              min_level => 'info',
              filename  => 'Somefile.log',
              mode      => '>>',
              newline   => 1
          ]
      ],
  );

  $log->emerg("I've fallen and I can't get up");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module acts exactly like L<Log::Dispatch::File> except that it
obtains an exclusive lock on the file while opening it.

Note that if you are using this output because you want to write to a file
from multiple processes, you should open the file with the append C<mode>
(C<<< >> >>>), or else it's quite likely that one process will overwrite
another.
